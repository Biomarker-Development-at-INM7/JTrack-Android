# Welcome to JuTrack Platfrom!



Hi! This is the repository for JuTrack smartphone application. JuTrack is an open-source platform for remote assessment of digital biomarkers (DB) in neurological, psychiatric and other indications. JuTrack platform consists of an **Android application** and an online **Dashboard** for managing research studies.

JuTrack application comprises the following main categories of components:

- Phone and Application Usage data
- (relative) Location data
- Human Activity Recognition (HAR) data 
-  Accelerometer Sensor data
- Gyroscope Sensor data
- Voice data * (only in Active assessment)  

JuTrack can collect the aforementioned data type in Passive (without user interaction) mode and labelling the collected data in Active (by user interaction) mode. All components are designed in a modular architecture which can be easily added or excluded.

*release in preparation
